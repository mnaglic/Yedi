# Yedi

Yedi (YAML-enabled dependency injection) is a dependency injection library for Java that uses
[YAML](http://www.yaml.org) for configuration.

I created it mostly to learn how to work with Git and Github, and also for hack value.
Still, if someone finds it useful, great. I plan to continue to work on this.

Read more about Yedi [here](http://mnaglic.github.com/Yedi/) and [check out the example app that uses it](http://github.com/mnaglic/Yedi/tree/master/yedi.examples.greeter).
